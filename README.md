## Parzenâ€“Rosenblatt (PR) window Constrained Isometric Mapping for Multimodal NSCLC Radiomic Analysis 

This code is a modified version of the isometric mapping algorithm, tested on 640 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases in computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging modalities. We provide 130 CT radiomics of NSCLC cases.
