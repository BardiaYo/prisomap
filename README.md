## Parzenâ€“Rosenblatt (PR) window Constrained Isometric Mapping for Multimodal NSCLC Radiomic Analysis 

This is modified version of the isometric mapping and testing on 640 none-small cell lung cancer cases in computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging modalities. We provided 130 CT radiomics of NSCLC cases. 

We used couple of codes from respected scientists and libraries that we cited and aknowledge their valuable contributions.
